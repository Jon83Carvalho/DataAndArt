Thus project stores all data and links to the page http://datandart.com.

This is a project to create art through data and bring to knowledge amazing information as well to bring new perspectives to data visualization.

I use mainly D3.js visualizations and data engineering to extract and load any kind of data to be used in the art.

So far I developed 2 arts, and working currently in a new one.

ART 1 - Is a way to read data from Meta data source about internet gender Gap. With it, not only an artistic view of the data but one can find that there might be a correlation between corrupcy and internet gap.

ART 2 - Love word, extract the frequency of the "love" word in different languages and expand and contracts the figure showing that the love is spread in a pulsing behavior. One time growing, the other decreasing.

ART 3 - is under development.
