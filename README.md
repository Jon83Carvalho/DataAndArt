This project stores all data and links to the page http://datandart.com.

This is a project to create art through data and bring to knowledge amazing information as well to bring new perspectives to data visualization.

I use mainly D3.js visualizations and data engineering to extract and load any kind of data to be used in the art.

So far I developed 3 arts, and working currently in a new one.

## ART 3 - Trade War
![Captura de tela de 2022-08-29 23-03-54](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/25573262/187332410-918ddf6d-4b3c-4a9e-beef-1e08074ac3c2.png)

X direction means volume of traded stocks, Y direction is the relative price to maximum and minimum negotiated in the specific stock (divided in fewer groups of price). Before war - means the thursday and friday before the scalation of Russian attack to Ukraine, after War is on 1st March where the tensions area clearly higher and and long war is evident. The markets, eventhought reacted in a recovery movement on the Friday before, by Tuesday 1st March, Nasdaq and other indexes dropped significantly.

The stock trades consider the top 20 higher stock prices (identified by different colors) in Nasdaq extracted in July through Alpaca API in the 2 mentioned periods, before war 24 to 25th and after war -> February and 28th to 1st March. The lenght of the "brush mark" as like an impressionist art work, indicates the frequency (counts) of a negotiated stock in that price with that volume, for example, a longer brush marker in the very left corner means a high frequency of negotiated stock with 1 paper. 

Note that before the war, trades are lower volumes, more diverse. After war trades consider are executed in higher volumes more frequently and more operations.

It is a clear picture of part of history in terms of trades.


## ART 2 - Love word 
Extracts the frequency of the "love" word in different languages from twitter API and expand and contracts the figure showing that the love is spread in a pulsing behavior. One time growing, the other decreasing.


## ART 1 - Internet gender GAP
Is a way to read data from Meta data source about internet gender Gap. With it, not only an artistic view of the data but one can find that there might be a correlation between corrupcy and internet gap.
